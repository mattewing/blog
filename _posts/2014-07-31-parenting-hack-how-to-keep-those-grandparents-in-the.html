<div>As soon as our son entered the world, it became apparent that we were going to generate way more photos than any sane human being would ever want to see&#8212;except our own parents who seem to have an insatiable appetite for these things. So, we needed to figure out some better system than posting everything on facebook.</div>
<p>I also really wanted an easily accessible and organized archive of our favorite pixs online.</p>
<p>Finally, the whole thing needed to be dead simple with as few steps as possible. I really didn&#8217;t want to have to remember to remember to write an update email every few weeks, or ask my parents to keep checking a website in hopes of new photos.</p>
<p>The short version of the solution I landed on is: set up a tumblr photo blog and use IFTTT to send emails to our family members when new photos were online.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the longer how-to version:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="http://tumblr.com" target="_blank">Create a tumblr blog</a>:</strong> I love tumblr for stuff like this because it&#8217;s super easy to set up, looks good, and has a strong iphone app. The last part is important since we take most of our pictures on our phones. The app makes it really easy to grab a few of your favorite pixs and turn them into a post.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://groups.google.com" target="_blank">Create a google group of your family members</a>:</strong> Figure out who wants to get pretty regular emails about new pixs of your kid and put them into a group. Once you&#8217;ve created a group, google will give you a group email address. Anything sent to that address will be sent along to everyone in your group. <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank">Create an IFTTT recipe:</a></strong> IFTTT (If this, than that) is a really simple way to stitch together different web services. In this case, I used it to send an email to our family google group every time there is a new post on the tumblr account. That way folks will know as soon as new photos are available.<br/><br/>These little scripts are called recipes. Here&#8217;s the one I created:</li>
</ul><p><br/><a class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_31" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/192383-sharing-photos-with-your-family" id="embed_recipe-192383" target="_blank"><img alt="IFTTT Recipe: Sharing photos with your family connects tumblr to gmail" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/192383" width="370px"/></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;re now all set to easily put your favorite photos online and make sure your family knows about it.</p>
<p>But, of course, there are a few more things you can do if you&#8217;re so inclined. Here are some of the additions I&#8217;ve piled on along the way:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Let a bigger group of your friends and family know about new posts every so often:</strong> It turns out that other folks in our life also wanted to get the occasional update. So, I created a separate google group that folks could sign up for, and created a IFTTT recipe that would only send emails after every 5 new posts&#8212;that way no one is overwhelmed, but they still can easily keep up.<br/><br/>BTW, if Facebook is more your speed, you could easily change the recipe to trigger a facebook post instead of an email. </li>
</ul><p><a class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_51" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/192382-easily-share-occasional-updates-with-your-community" id="embed_recipe-192382" target="_blank"><img alt="IFTTT Recipe: Easily share occasional updates with your community connects tumblr to gmail" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/192382" width="370px"/><br/></a></p>
<ul><li><strong>Back up your photos:</strong> I&#8217;ve got yet another recipe running that saves every new image I post to tumblr into a folder on dropbox. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it works pretty well as an automated double backup option for these precious photos.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Move pixs from your &#8220;real camera&#8221; to your blog:</strong> In addition to our phones, we still use our nicer &#8220;real camera&#8221; from time to time. But, those great pixs always ended up staying on the camera because getting them online felt like such a hassle. It&#8217;s far from perfect, but Eyefi memory cards have worked pretty well as a solution here. They&#8217;re standard memory cards for a nicer camera, but they&#8217;ve got built in wifi. That means you can push your photos over to your phone. Once they&#8217;re on your phone, getting them into tumblr is super easy. And now the world can see your fancy photos.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Printing things on paper:</strong> One really nice side effect of this approach is that it makes creating something like a &#8220;Huck&#8217;s first year&#8221; book really easy. I just went through the tumblr blog, downloaded my favorite pixs locally, imported them into iPhoto and maybe a nice hardcover book using Apple&#8217;s handy tools. This turns out to be a big hit with the grandparents.</li>
