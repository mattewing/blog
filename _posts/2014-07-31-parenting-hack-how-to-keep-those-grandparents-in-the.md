As soon as our son entered the world, it became apparent that we were going to generate way more photos than any sane human being would ever want to see—except our own parents who seem to have an insatiable appetite for these things. So, we needed to figure out some better system than posting everything on facebook.
I also really wanted an easily accessible and organized archive of our favorite pixs online.
Finally, the whole thing needed to be dead simple with as few steps as possible. I really didn’t want to have to remember to remember to write an update email every few weeks, or ask my parents to keep checking a website in hopes of new photos.
The short version of the solution I landed on is: set up a tumblr photo blog and use IFTTT to send emails to our family members when new photos were online.

Here’s the longer how-to version:
Create a tumblr blog: I love tumblr for stuff like this because it’s super easy to set up, looks good, and has a strong iphone app. The last part is important since we take most of our pictures on our phones. The app makes it really easy to grab a few of your favorite pixs and turn them into a post.
Create a google group of your family members: Figure out who wants to get pretty regular emails about new pixs of your kid and put them into a group. Once you’ve created a group, google will give you a group email address. Anything sent to that address will be sent along to everyone in your group. 
Create an IFTTT recipe: IFTTT (If this, than that) is a really simple way to stitch together different web services. In this case, I used it to send an email to our family google group every time there is a new post on the tumblr account. That way folks will know as soon as new photos are available.These little scripts are called recipes. Here’s the one I created:

That’s it! You’re now all set to easily put your favorite photos online and make sure your family knows about it.
But, of course, there are a few more things you can do if you’re so inclined. Here are some of the additions I’ve piled on along the way:
Let a bigger group of your friends and family know about new posts every so often: It turns out that other folks in our life also wanted to get the occasional update. So, I created a separate google group that folks could sign up for, and created a IFTTT recipe that would only send emails after every 5 new posts—that way no one is overwhelmed, but they still can easily keep up.BTW, if Facebook is more your speed, you could easily change the recipe to trigger a facebook post instead of an email. 

Back up your photos: I’ve got yet another recipe running that saves every new image I post to tumblr into a folder on dropbox. It’s not perfect, but it works pretty well as an automated double backup option for these precious photos.
Move pixs from your “real camera” to your blog: In addition to our phones, we still use our nicer “real camera” from time to time. But, those great pixs always ended up staying on the camera because getting them online felt like such a hassle. It’s far from perfect, but Eyefi memory cards have worked pretty well as a solution here. They’re standard memory cards for a nicer camera, but they’ve got built in wifi. That means you can push your photos over to your phone. Once they’re on your phone, getting them into tumblr is super easy. And now the world can see your fancy photos.
Printing things on paper: One really nice side effect of this approach is that it makes creating something like a “Huck’s first year” book really easy. I just went through the tumblr blog, downloaded my favorite pixs locally, imported them into iPhoto and maybe a nice hardcover book using Apple’s handy tools. This turns out to be a big hit with the grandparents.
